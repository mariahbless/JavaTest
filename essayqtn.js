// ESSAY QUESTION 1 TO 5 

// 1. Explain the difference between let, const, and var in JavaScript
// Var is a function - scope which is only accessible within the function whic is decleared and can be reassigned avalue and redecleared within the same scope
// Let is blocked-scope which can be reassigned avalue but cannot be redecleared
// Const is a blocked scope which cannot be reassigned after it has been assigned a value

// 2. What are JavaScript objects, and how are they different from arrays?
//  An object is a collection of key-value pairs, uses curly braces {} and  representing entities with properties,
// while Arrays  are an ordered list of values, it uses square brackets [] and store data in an ordered list, where each element has an index (ordered).


// 3. Explain the difference between == and === in JavaScript.
// Loose Equality == performs type coercion and compares the values loosely.
// === does not perform type coercion and compares both value and type strictly.


// 4. What is an event in JavaScript? Provide an example of how to handle a button click event.
//An event in JavaScript represents an interaction or occurrence that JavaScript can respond to.
//  Events are often handled by adding an event listener to an element and associating the event with a function that will execute 


// 5. Describe the forEach and map methods in JavaScript. How are they similar, and how do they differ?
// The forEach method is used to execute a provided function once for each element in an array. It does not return a new array but simply iterates through the array and performs the given action
// The map method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the array. Unlike forEach, map returns a new array with transformed values, leaving the original array unchanged
